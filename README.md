# Random Password Generator
The purpose of this project is to create a web application where the user can generate a random password based on the criteria they choose. Their options for criteria are the length of the password, if they want lowercase letters, if they want uppercase letters, if they want numerical characters, and/or if they want special characters.

## Description
A web application with a form that will display a randomly generated password after the user answers the prompts to decide which criteria they would like for their result.
